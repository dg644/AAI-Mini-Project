Project Description: 

Facial expression, pain and depression are often intricately related. In concurrence, the problem of trustworthiness (e.g. fairness, bias, generalisation, explainability) in ML methods is also becoming an increasing source of concern. Till date, a thorough analysis and understanding of the intricate relationship between facial expression, pain and depression is not adequately understood. In this work, we will (1) train and evaluate various ML and deep learning algorithms for predicting and analysing the relationship between facial expression, pain and depression detection, (2) evaluate and compare among the performance and trustworthiness (e.g. fairness, explainability) of different machine learning/ deep learning algorithms and bias mitigation strategies based on the findings uncovered and (3) propose novel methods to achieve better performance and trustworthiness for facial expression recognition, pain and depression detection.
